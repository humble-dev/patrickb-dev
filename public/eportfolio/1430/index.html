    <p>Hi, I'm Patrick! I was born in the Philippines and spent my childhood
        in Metro Manila. Later in life I spent a lot of time on a small island
        in the Puget Sound, close to Seattle, WA. I moved to Utah in 2015 and
        <a href='married.jpg'>met my sweet, wonderful, beautiful wife</a>
        <i>immediately upon arrival</i>. Now we pay our bills together
        <a href='simonyawn.jpg'>and have a cat</a>. Here's a video:<br><br>

    <h2>Nowadays...</h2>
    <p style="color:firebrick"><b>Currently</b> I am a computer science student
        at <a href='http://www.slcc.edu'>Salt Lake Community College</a>! My
        favorite computer related memory has to be when my dad let me play
        "Lemmings" on his old laptop in the 90's. We also used to have problems
        with our mouse a lot when I was a kid and I remember learning how to
        navigate using keyboard shortcuts and MS DOS. Does that show my age?
        When I had windows 95 I was really interested in customizing the look
        of it and would find hacks on the internet for changing the start button,
        for example. And then when I was trying to make it as a musician, I
        learned how to use Apple computers. Computers are <b><i>neato TO THE
                MAX!!!</b></i>

    <h3>Here's a shortlist of some of my goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To be <a href='https://collegeinfogeek.com/'>a great student.</a>
        </li>
        <li>To be <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/'>a knowledgeable human
                being.</a> (Khan Academy helped me nearly ace the Accuplacer
            - I skipped 2 math classes!)
        <li>To finish <a href='messyoffice.jpg'>cleaning and organizing my
                office</a> finally.</li>
        <li>See more National Parks with my wife like
            <a href='angelslanding.jpg'>Zion</a> and <a href='capitolreef.jpg'>
                Capitol Reef</a>.</li>
        <li>To know how to create <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/'>great
                looking webpages</a>!</li>
        <li>To see <a href='philippinesfam.jpg'>my family in the Philippines
            </a> again but with my wife this time.</li>
        <li>To develop <a href='https://habitica.com/'>bullet-proof habits</a>.
        <li>To be the kind of person that owns a
            <a href='https://www.fairphone.com/en/our-goals/'>Fairphone.</a>
        </li>
        <li>To have some <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoXg7SSmGyk'>
                little <i>ni√±os</i></a> of our own.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Top ten signs you've been on the internet for too long:</h2>
    <ol style="color:firebrick">
        <li>It would take you too long for it to be worth the effort to count
            how many tabs you have open.</li>
        <li>You have committed the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching'>
                I Ching</a> to memory via <a href='http://deoxy.org/iching'>
                this obscure website</a>.</li>
        <li>Turn your neck to the right, and then to the left, look up, look
            down. Did that cause a massive amount of pain?</li>
        <li>You are starting to read YouTube comments even though every single
            one of them makes you mad.</li>
        <li>You know what I mean when I say
            <a href='http://i.imgur.com/t7AuiYv.gif'>"fractal corgi"</a>.</li>
        <li>It gives you anxiety to think of how many bookmarks you actually
            have in your browser that are not sorted at all.</li>
        <li>You googled 'mermaid corgi' and
            <a href='http://i.imgur.com/fiqKA7K.jpg'>liked what you saw</a>.
        </li>
        <li>You're tired, feel depressed for no reason, sick of sitting down
            and your back hurts.</li>
        <li>You have a sweet, <a href='https://androidify.com/'>android logo
                avatar version of yourself</a> on your own website.</li>
        <li>Your wife has fallen asleep without you and that makes you really
            sad even though you're only a room away.</li>
    </ol>
