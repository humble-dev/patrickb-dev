                <td width='65%'>When I was still a rookie funeral director, I had
                    to retrieve the body of a 400 pound man from the morgue whose
                    organs had just been harvested for the organ donor program. 
                    The chamber in which his body was placed was 7 feet above the ground.
                    It was up to me and 2 security guys to transfer the body to 
                    the gurney I had brought in. The first move went alright except
                    that the body bag had ripped open and fluids had spilled onto
                    the floor. It made one of the security guys extremely uncomfortable
                    and he had to leave. The other security guy placed a towel on
                    the floor to soak up some fluid and asked that we run the gurney's
                    wheels onto the towel so it wouldn't track fluid through the
                    hallway. As we pushed it onto the towel, the weight of the 
                    body was so much that the wheel twisted and the gurney tipped 
                    over and the body fell off of it. Even completely flat, the
                    gurney was too high off the ground to slide the body onto it. It simply 
                    took brute force and a lot of elbow grease for two guys to 
                    (literally) dead lift the body back onto the gurney. It took an 
                    hour and a half and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do on the job.
                    What I mean to illustrate is this: <b><i>if you want someone 
                            who is willing to stick it out on an engineering project
                            all the way to the end no matter how messy or complicated
                            the situation, look no further</i></b>.</td>
